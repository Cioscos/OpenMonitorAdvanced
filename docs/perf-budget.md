# Performance budget

Budget (spec §1.2), measured with `scripts/measure-footprint.ps1` on a release build.
Memory = private working set (Task Manager "Memory" column); CPU = share of all logical processors.

| Milestone | Machine | Mode | App CPU % | App private MB | WebView2 procs | Total private MB | Budget met |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32 GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200 | window | 0 | 15.0 | 6 | 112.5 | yes |
| M1 | same machine | tray | 0.01 | 12.3 | 0 | 12.3 | yes |
| M2 | same machine, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (driver 32.0.16.1714) + AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics iGPU Raphael (driver 32.0.21045.5002), build `d678c21` | window | 0.05 | 18.2 | 6 | 113.3 | yes |
| M2 | same machine, same drivers, build `d678c21` | tray | 0.05 | 16.7 | 0 | 16.7 | yes |

Budget: app CPU < 1 % at idle; tray < 30 MB; window open < 200 MB in total.

## M2 measurement details

Measured 2026-09-25 on the development machine, release build `d678c21`
(`cd app && pnpm tauri build --no-bundle`), 15 s warm-up + 30 s sample per run
(the script's defaults), no crash marker present, no other `oma-app.exe`
instance running. In both modes `VendorModules : atiadlxx.dll, nvapi64.dll,
nvml.dll` — all three vendor libraries were loaded, so the measurement is not
a safe-mode result.

Raw output:

```
Mode              : window
CorePercentCpu    : 0.05
AppPrivateMB      : 18.2
WebView2Processes : 6
TotalPrivateMB    : 113.3
VendorModules     : atiadlxx.dll, nvapi64.dll, nvml.dll

Mode              : tray
CorePercentCpu    : 0.05
AppPrivateMB      : 16.7
WebView2Processes : 0
TotalPrivateMB    : 16.7
VendorModules     : atiadlxx.dll, nvapi64.dll, nvml.dll
```

All budget items are met on both modes. `AppPrivateMB` grew by about 3-4 MB
over the M1 baseline (window: 15.0 → 18.2; tray: 12.3 → 16.7), consistent
with the private working set added by the three vendor libraries and their
NVML/NVAPI/ADL handles; this run does not isolate that delta further because
it stayed comfortably under budget, so a safe-mode comparison and a
`VirtualUnlock` before/after measurement were not repeated on this build.

Note: private working set is not the same as committed memory.
`VirtualUnlock` (Task 7, on the `nvml.dll` `.data` section) can remove pages
from the working set without freeing the library's underlying allocations, so
a low `AppPrivateMB`/`TotalPrivateMB` here does not by itself mean the vendor
libraries hold no committed memory — only that it is not currently resident.
The finer-grained figures from the spike recorded in the M2 plan
(`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-m2-gpu.md`), e.g. the ~19 MB NVML `.data`
section before/after `VirtualUnlock` or the isolated per-library vendor delta,
are prior spike evidence, not reproduced against this final build; see the
plan for those references.
